During a game, you accidently hit the volly ball into the back of the head of a one of the basketball players. You run over to apologize. The man smiles at you and introduces himself at Mike. The glimmer in his eye shows he likes you. Oh the hardships of being the main character in a early 2000's romance novle. After only a briefe moment of talking, you are apporched by another girl.

You turn and see three couples and a lownly sexy boy all by himself. Jessica takes the honers in telling you who these kids are. The Cullens. Children of Docter Cullen and his wife Esme. All the children were adopted by the two, and now have borderline incestiral relationships with eachother. Jessica says it's weird. Angele tries to defend it. You make a mental note to ask how Angela feels about her siblings if she has any. The one lone sexy boy passes you. Jessica mentions his name. Edward Cullen. She mummbles to herself that Edward thinks he's too good for anyone in this school. You don't care. You are looking at lonely sexy Edward Cullen. When he sits down. He shares a smile to his brother and then looks at you. His eyes narrow and his brow furrow. He seems confused by you. How romantic. There is not glimmer in his eye, showing he does not like you.

He scoffes and crosses his arms. a naisly voice is hard as he glars at the lady. 'My fatehr will hear about th- oh wait no sorry. Wrong early 2000's book franchises. My apologies. Lonely sexy Edward huffs and storms out. He glars at you on his way out an dmummbles under his breath. Too low for you to make it out completly but it sounded close to him saying he will just 'have to indure it' What ever the hell that means. You hand the lady your slip of paper and she thanks you. Once you exit the office, you see Eric and Mike have waited for you and as you three walk to the parking lot, they ask you how you like the school and the classes. You nod along to their chatter till you get to your truck. You turn to tell them to have a nice day, and to thank them for all their help. They both blush and look down at the gravel. Eric even maneges out a nervouse giggle. That is when Eric invites you to come hang out at a small mall strip on the other side of town with Mike, Angele, Jessuica, Laurean, Tyler, and himself.

He is a bit upset you didn't at least call him and tell him, but he is more then thrilled you enjoyed your first day so much. You go to bed with a smile on your face and a few new shirts hanging up in your closet. But here yet again, that wasn't very clumbsy shy uncordinated main chatacter of you, so I will have to make you die in your sleep so you can choose more unwisely next time.
